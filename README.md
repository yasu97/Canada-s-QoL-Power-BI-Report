# Canada-QoL-Power-BI-Report
In this Power BI project, the primary focus is on exploring and visualizing the main dimensions of the Quality of Life Framework as defined by Statistics Canada. The analysis is structured around five core dimensions that collectively provide a comprehensive view of the quality of life in Canada. These dimensions are:

1. **Health:** This dimension encompasses various aspects of physical and mental health that influence the quality of life. For this analysis, the key indicator used was self-rated health.

2. **Prosperity:** This dimension examines the economic factors that contribute to quality of life, such as income, employment, and wealth distribution. The primary indicator analyzed was household income.

3. **Environment:** Environmental quality and sustainability are critical components of the quality of life. The key indicator analyzed in this dimension was water quality.

4. **Good Governance:** This dimension evaluates the effectiveness and fairness of governance structures and processes. The primary indicator used was the severity crime index.

5. **Society:** This dimension focuses on social relationships and community engagement. The key indicators used were "someone to count on" and "sense of belonging."

This comprehensive analysis using Power BI provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the quality of life in Canada, aiding policymakers, researchers, and the general public in understanding and improving overall well-being.
